            <h2>Our Fees</h2>
            <p>We believe that everyone should be able to participate and learn this wonderful art regardless of
            their financial situation and status. We do however, need to cover fees such as renting the hall
            where we practice every week and the instructor. As such, to only cover our costs, we ask that members pay a fee of:</p>
            <p id="tendollarclass"> $10 / class</p>
            <p>Members may pay up to a month's worth of fees in advance ($40). Members who are consistent and timely with their payments
            for a period of 3 months will receive a complementary discount of 10% for one class. If you still find
            financial hardship in this, please don't hesitate to contact us and we will see if you qualify for any
            additional discounts.</p>
