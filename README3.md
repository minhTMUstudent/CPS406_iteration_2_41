**CLUB MANAGEMENT APPLICATION**
Welcome to the Club Management Application! This application is designed to help manage the finances and attendance of a small amateur club, such as a salsa dancing group. With features to track payments, manage member attendance, and handle scheduling, this app aims to streamline club management tasks.

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
Our project aims to streamline the management of a small amateur club, with weekly practice sessions led by an amateur coach. We're developing the 
Club Management Application to handle various administrative tasks, including finance tracking, member attendance, and communication. Members pay a $10 fee per session or in advance for up to a month, with discounts available. The application will provide detailed financial records, manage member attendance, send practice reminders, and address payment issues. Key tasks include providing the treasurer with unpaid debt logs, managing current month account payables, and creating a member log for efficient organization. We'll implement a system 
to incentivize timely payments and empower the coach with communication tools. Additionally, we'll create user-friendly interfaces for new and existing members to register and log in. Ultimately, our goal is to create a well-organized and harmonious club environment that prioritizes member engagement and enjoyment.

**USAGE**
**Track Club Finances**
1. Income Statement: The treasurer can generate an income statement to monitor the club's financial health. This statement includes revenue from member payments and any additional sources, as well as expenses such as coach payments and hall rental fees.
2. Monthly Comparison: The app maintains a year-long log of monthly profits, allowing the treasurer to analyze trends and identify opportunities to increase revenue or reduce expenses.

**Log and Sort Members**
1. Attendance Sorting: Members are sorted based on their frequency of attendance. Those with higher attendance receive loyalty discounts, encouraging continued participation and member retention.
2. Discounts: The top 10 members with the most practice attendance receive a 10% discount for one class, incentivizing active participation.

**User Interaction**
1. Management Interfaces: The treasurer can manage the coach list and schedule, while the coach has control over the members list. This includes adding or removing participants, with notifications sent to the respective parties upon any changes.
2. Scheduling and Payment: Members can schedule and pay for practices within the app. A user-friendly interface facilitates payment methods, with notifications sent to the treasurer and coach upon scheduling and payment completion, providing details such as user ID, class amount, and relevant coach.
